    // FAQ page
    faqTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    faqQuestion1: "What are my strengths?",
    faqAnswer1: "One of my key strengths is my methodical approach to challenges and my ability to develop analytical solutions. I'm also highly adaptable in team settings and don't shy away from taking responsibility. On the contrary, I actively try to support others with their workload whenever possible. I'm a strong communicator who builds genuine and sincere relationships not only within my own team but also across different departments. This is something my colleagues often recognize and appreciate.",
    faqQuestion2: "What are my weaknesses?",
    faqAnswer2: "Although I tend to be well-balanced once I settle into a role, I can be quite ambitious and perfectionistic at the beginning. This sometimes leads me to place too much pressure on myself as I strive to meet high standards right from the start. I'm learning to manage this by setting more realistic short-term goals at the beginning and reminding myself that learning takes time. It's helped me stay motivated without overwhelming myself.",
    faqQuestion3: "What motivates me in a workplace?",
    faqAnswer3: "What motivates me the most is doing meaningful work where I can clearly see the impact of my efforts. I'm deeply motivated when I feel that my ideas are heard and valued even if they're not implemented, understanding the reasoning behind the decision is very important to me. Building strong, respectful communication with my teammates and growing together through mutual feedback is another key source of motivation. Additionally, I really value companies that invest in their employees' growth and well-being—such as offering learning opportunities, social activities, or flexibility.",
    faqQuestion4: "How do I deal with stress and intense pace?",
    faqAnswer4: "To manage stress, I first take a short break and breathe. When I return to my desk, I set a list of priorities and break the work into smaller tasks. If I can't find a solution on my own due to time or complexity, I'm not hesitant to ask for support. If there's a task that needs to be completed, I'm ready to work overtime depending on the circumstances.",
    faqQuestion5: "What did I do at Datateam?",
    faqAnswer5: "I initially joined the company as an intern and later continued working part-time.\n\nDuring my part-time period, I was involved in the development of a Business Intelligence (BI) product called ThothBI. Since the product was largely completed, I primarily worked independently, focusing on bug fixes and implementing new feature requests. ThothBI was used by various public institutions to meet their corporate reporting and analysis needs.\n\nAfter transitioning to a full-time position, I worked on a crime analysis project named Datactive, also developed for public institutions. I was occasionally involved in on-site operations during the project.\nI had the opportunity to contribute to nearly all layers of the project, including:\n\n• Bug fixing processes\n• Development of new modules\n• Charting infrastructure\n• Multi-language support\n• UI/UX design and integration\n\nI took initiative where I saw the need, writing clean, maintainable code and directly implementing improvements in areas I found lacking.\n\nIn addition, I also:\n\n• Supported DevOps processes (version control between environments, deployment operations)\n• Carried out database-related tasks such as writing stored procedures and database migration\n\nTechnologies used: VueJS, VivaGraph, D3, .Net, AngularJS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MsSQL, Docker, Git, npm",
    faqQuestion6: "What did I do at Usta?",
    faqAnswer6: "I started working on the new version of the project developed for the Credit Guarantee Fund at this company. Later, I transitioned to the Water and Wastewater project, where I had the opportunity to work with microservice and micro front-end architectures. I took an active role in the team developing a module from scratch.\n\nI'm aware that this 2-month experience may not look ideal from the outside. The short duration was due to a mismatch between my values and the company's in terms of technical approaches and work culture. As a result, I decided to pursue opportunities that align better with my goals and vision.\n\nTechnologies: .NET, Entity Framework, React, Redis, Jenkins",
    faqQuestion7: "What do I do at SESTEK?",
    faqAnswer7: "If I were to describe my role in the company in broader terms, I would say I'm \"at the source of the flow.\" I develop integrations with contact centers, enabling the flow of data from the interfaces where customer-firm calls are recorded.\n\nSince I joined, I have developed both real-time and offline analytics integrations with several contact center platforms, including Nice, Genesys, and XCally. The data received from these systems is routed to various company products such as Conversational Analytics, Text-to-Speech, and Virtual Agent.\n\nIn addition to these integrations, I also contribute to the development of our Call Recorder product. For example, I restructured services that previously communicated via REST API to use WebSocket, resulting in a more stable and faster communication infrastructure.\n\nAs of June 2025, I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer, a role I took on after starting as a Software Engineer.",

    faqQuestion5: "Datateam'de neler yaptım?",
    faqAnswer5: "İlk olarak bu şirkette stajımı tamamladım ve sonrasında part-time olarak çalışmaya başladım.\n\nPart-time döneminde, ThothBI adlı Business Intelligence (BI) ürününün geliştirilmesinde görev aldım. Ürün büyük oranda tamamlanmıştı; bu nedenle geliştirme sürecinde çoğunlukla tek başıma çalışarak bugfix'ler ve yeni taleplerin geliştirilmesiyle ilgilendim. ThothBI, çeşitli kamu kurumlarında kurumsal raporlama ve analiz ihtiyaçlarını karşılamak üzere kullanılan bir yazılımdı.\n\nFull-time olarak işe başladığımda, Datactive adlı suç analizi projesinde görev aldım. Bu proje de kamu kurumlarına yönelikti ve belirli dönemlerde sahada da aktif olarak yer aldım.\nProjede neredeyse tüm katmanlara dokunma fırsatı buldum:\n\n• Bugfix süreçleri\n• Yeni modül geliştirme\n• Grafik altyapısı\n• Çoklu dil desteği\n• UI/UX tasarımı ve entegrasyonu\n\nİhtiyaç gördüğüm noktalarda inisiyatif alarak projede eksik bulduğum alanlara sürdürülebilir, temiz kodlar yazdım, bazı modülleri en baştan güncelledim.\n\nBunlara ek olarak;\n\n• DevOps süreçlerine destek verdim (ortamlar arası versiyon yönetimi, deploy işlemleri)\n• Veri tabanı tarafında prosedür yazımı, veri tabanı taşıma gibi operasyonları gerçekleştirdim\n\nTeknolojiler: VueJS, VivaGraph, D3, .Net, AngularJS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MsSQL, Docker, Git, npm",

Sıfırdan geliştirilen bir modülde ekip içinde aktif rol aldım.\n\nBu şirketteki 2 aylık kısa süreli tecrübemin dışarıdan hoş görünmediğinin farkındayım. Kısa olmasının sebebi ise teknik yaklaşımlar ve çalışma kültürü açısından değerlerimin şirketinkilerle örtüşmediğini fark ettim. Bu nedenle, hedeflerime ve vizyonuma daha uygun fırsatları değerlendirmeye karar verdim.\n\nTeknolojiler: .NET, EntityFramework, React, Redis, Jenkins",
    faqQuestion7: "SESTEK'de neler yaptım/yapıyorum?",
    faqAnswer7: "Şirkette yaptığım işi genel çerçevede değerlendirecek olursak, \"musluğun başında durmak\" olarak tanımlayabiliriz. Çağrı merkezlerine entegrasyonlar geliştiriyorum; yani müşteriler ile firmalar arasında gerçekleşen çağrıların kaydedildiği arayüzlere bağlanarak veri akışını sağlıyorum.\n\nİşe başladığımdan bu yana Nice, Genesys ve XCally gibi çeşitli contact center sistemleriyle hem gerçek zamanlı hem de offline analizlere yönelik entegrasyonlar geliştirdim. Bu sistemlerden gelen verileri şirketin Conversational Analytics, Text-to-Speech ve Virtual Agent gibi ürünlerine yönlendiriyorum.\n\nEntegrasyonların yanı sıra, şirketin Call Recorder ürününün geliştirilmesinde de görev alıyorum. Örneğin, REST API üzerinden haberleşen servisleri WebSocket ile çalışacak şekilde yeniden yapılandırarak daha stabil ve hızlı bir iletişim altyapısı sağladım.\n\nHaziran 2025 itibarıyla, Kıdemli Yazılım Mühendisi olarak çalışmaya devam ediyorum.",
